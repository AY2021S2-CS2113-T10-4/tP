# NusFoodReviews

NUS FOOD REVIEW is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for all NUS students especially NUS Freshmen who 
are often not well-informed of the places to eat. It displays the menus, reviews and ratings of some eateries in NUS.
Users are also able to add reviews and ratings as well.

Other than the public user mode, there is an admin mode where, the admin has special permissions and privileges where 
he/she can add canteens, stores, menu and delete the reviews, canteens, menus, and stores.
